> 1. Generate complete file/folder skeleton with stub files
>    (correct imports, type signatures, TODO comments, no implementation)
> 2. Implement prisma/schema.prisma in full
> 3. Implement lib/auth.ts
> 4. Implement api/auth/signup, api/auth/login, api/auth/logout
> 5. Implement api/me
> Do not implement anything beyond this list.
